# Asthma-Inequality
The purpose of this work is to predict asthma emergency admissions using machine learning. 
This predictive model will help health practictioners know patients at risk of emergency admissions.

This portfolio includes:

Python Code for generating synthetic asthma patients demographics and clinical events.
SQL Server queries to derive patient's clinical outcomes based on synthetic data.
Cluster analysis used in a machine learning predictive model for forecasting asthma emergency admissions.
#NB: This is a synthetic data with no actual relationships between variables.
